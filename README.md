# UIU_QUESTION_BANK-web-application-project-
In my Database management system course, I created a webpage and  this webpage's name was UIU Question Bank. It was in a local host  system. The main reason for making this type of webpage was that many  students especially fresher do not understand their academic  examination question patterns. As a result, their exam does not well as  they expected. This webpage will help them tremendously to get perfect  results. On this webpage, both persons such as faculty or student can  upload their previous question and if any student doesnâ€™t know the  answer to that question can ask the answer of that question by  comment section or particularly e-mail, and faculty or student can solve  that question. At first, any person has to sign in to their account. Lastly,  for creating this helpful website I used various tools and software such as  Brackets (HTML, CSS, PHP) &amp; XAMPP (MySQL) etc
